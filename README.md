# Pumpfun smart contract replica

The poing of this projec is to make the duplication of the pumpfun smart contract based on their peculiar bonding curve.

Their smart contract was good because it made 30SOL of virtual amount in the curve as a sol reserve

Tried to duplicate this logic into this contract, and you can test it yourself, if you are passionate with smart contact development

Raydium integration part is omitted for some reason, since this logic is used with another project.

If you need help or assistance with this project, contact here.
